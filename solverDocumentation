solver00
scoring xs = scoreFlow xs * countZeros xs
recusion:
every branch has the same weight as his trees
avg(sum(branches)+tree)

solver01
scoring xs = scoreFlow xs * countZeros xs
recursion:
avg(avg(branches) + tree)
the branches average is weighted as much as the tree

solver02
scoring xs = scoreFlow xs * countZeros xs
recursion:
only the last branches count
sum(branches)

solver03
scoring xs = scoreFlow xs * countZeros xs
recursion:
only the last branches count
avg(branches)
should do exactly the same as 02
